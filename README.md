this repository is for a Laravel PHP Framework app designed to :

- accept uploaded csv files of merchant information 
- dispatch emails to a vendor to request unique identifiers for use in debit card processing
- allow the response document (the same form but with merchant and terminal ID's provided by the vendor) to be uploaded
- store the information

it is wicked simple
